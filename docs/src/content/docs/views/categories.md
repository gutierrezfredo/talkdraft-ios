## Purpose

Categories let users organize notes into color-coded buckets (e.g., Ideas, Tasks, Journal, Work). Each category has a name and a color.

## Categories List

Accessed from the home screen's navigation. Displays all user-created categories with:
- Color indicator
- Category name
- Note count

Tap a category to edit it. Long-press and drag to reorder.

## Category Form

Used for both creating and editing categories. Appears as a sheet with:

- **Name field** — up to 50 characters, auto-focused on open
- **Color picker** — grid of 12 color options (blue, violet, red, pink, orange, yellow, lime, green, teal, cyan, indigo, gray)
- **Save button** — creates or updates the category
- **Delete button** — (edit mode only) deletes the category with a confirmation dialog showing how many notes will be unassigned

### Inline Creation

Categories can also be created inline from:
- The "+" chip at the end of the home screen's category bar
- The "+" button in the category picker sheet (on note detail)

Both open the same category form sheet.

## Deleting a Category

When a category is deleted:
- All notes assigned to that category become **uncategorized**
- Notes are not deleted — only the category assignment is removed
- A confirmation dialog shows the affected note count: "This will unassign 5 notes from this category. Notes won't be deleted."

## Reordering

Categories can be reordered by long-pressing and dragging on the home screen's category chip bar. The sort order persists across sessions.

## Limits

- **Free users:** 4 categories maximum
- **Pro users:** Unlimited categories

Attempting to create a category beyond the free limit triggers the paywall.
