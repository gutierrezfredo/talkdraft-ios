## What is Talkdraft?

Talkdraft is an iOS app for capturing thoughts on the go — by voice or text. Voice memos are transcribed by AI, rewritten in any tone, and organized into color-coded categories. It turns scattered brain dumps into clean, searchable notes.

## Core Loop

1. **Capture** — tap record (voice) or type (text)
2. **Transcribe** — Groq Whisper converts voice to text automatically
3. **Title** — Gemini Flash generates a short title in the background
4. **Organize** — assign to color-coded categories, add checkboxes, bullet lists
5. **Refine** — rewrite in 17+ tones, translate, edit freely

## Key Capabilities
