## Download

Talkdraft is available on the App Store for iPhone (iOS 26+).

## Sign In

Talkdraft supports four sign-in methods:

- **Apple** — fastest option, uses your Apple ID
- **Google** — sign in with your Google account
- **Email + Password** — traditional email/password registration
- **Anonymous** — try the app without an account (data persists until you sign in)

All authentication is handled through Supabase Auth. Users can link additional providers later.

## First Steps

1. **Create your first note** — tap the record button in the toolbar to capture a voice memo, or the compose button to type a text note
2. **Let AI work** — after recording, your voice is transcribed automatically and a title is generated in the background
3. **Organize** — create categories (e.g., Ideas, Tasks, Journal) and assign notes to them
4. **Refine** — use AI Rewrite to clean up, formalize, or restyle any note

## Account Management

- **Delete account** — available in Settings. Schedules a 30-day grace period before permanent deletion. Can be canceled during the grace period.
- **Subscription** — upgrade to Pro from the paywall screen for longer recordings and unlimited notes/categories.
